## Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze page views and user behavior on a book reading platform and to develop a personalized book recommendation system. This analysis aims to:

- Identify trends, peak usage periods, and user engagement metrics for website optimization.
- Enhance user experience through machine learning-based book recommendations.

## Dataset

- **Website Analytics Dataset**: This dataset contains time-stamped page views, Date for providing insights into user behavior, seasonal patterns, and variations over time.
- **Books Dataset**: This dataset includes information on book titles, authors, publishers, average ratings, number of pages, ratings count, publication date, and other relevant metadata.

You can access the Books Dataset on Kaggle using the following link: [Goodreads Books Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks).

## Preprocessing

- **Data Cleaning:** Filtered outliers and handled missing values in the page views dataset to ensure accurate analysis.
